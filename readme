ABOUT THE EQUATION
The basic equation is:
ddt(u)+laplacian(u)+second order laplacian(u)
but, in openfoam, we cannot solve it in the same matrix, so we have to separate the variable especially for the second order laplacian.
v = laplacian(u), w = laplacian(v)

then the equation become:
ddt(u) + v + w

But, the dimensions are not consistent (which makes the addition operation cannot be done), so we have to multiply it with coefficients with certain dimensions to make the equation non dimensional.

Let say, the dimension of u is in length, u [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]

we can reconstruct the equation as follows:
A*ddt(u) + B*v + C*w

then calculate the dimension
ddt(u) [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0] --> A [0 -1 1 0 0 0 0]
v= laplacian(u)
v = [0 -1 0 0 0 0 0] --> B [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
w = laplacian(w)
w [0 -3 0 0 0 0 0] --> C [0 3 0 0 0 0 0]

HOW TO COMPILE
just run "wmake", and "KSfoam" will be executable

HOW TO RUN
just make the mesh via "blockMesh", then run with "KSfoam"
you can edit the mesh in blockMesh, and change the initial and boundary conditions in 0 folder
